      <a name="Network"><h1><u>2.&nbsp;Networks</h1></u></a>
      <p>A network is a set of devices (often referred to as <a class="glossary_anchors" href="./Glossary.html#Gnode" id="node"><b>nodes</b></a>) connected by communication
        links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending and/or
        receiving data generated by other nodes on the network</p>
      <a name="Distributed">
        <h2>Distributed Processing</h2>
      </a>
      <p>Most networks use distributed processing, in which a task is divided among multiple
        computers. Instead of one single large machine being responsible for all aspects of a
        process, separate computers (usually a personal computer or workstation) handle a
        subset</p>
      <a name="criteria">
        <h2>Network Criteria</h2>
      </a>
      <p>A network must be able to meet a certain number of criteria. The most important of
        these are performance, reliability, and security.</p>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>Performance can be measured in many ways, including transit time and response time.
        Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to
        another. Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response. The performance of a network
        depends on a number of factors, including the number of users,
        the type of transmission medium, the capabilities of the connected hardware, and the
        efficiency of the software.</p>
      <p>Performance is often evaluated by two networking metrics: throughput and delay.
        We often need more throughput and less delay. However, these two criteria are often
        contradictory. If we try to send more data to the network, we may increase throughput
        but we increase the delay because of traffic congestion in the network.</p>
      <h3>Reliability</h3>
      <p>In addition to accuracy of delivery, network reliability is measured by the frequency of
        failure, the time it takes a link to recover from a failure, and the network's <a class="glossary_anchors" href="./Glossary.html#Grob" id="rob"><b>robustness</b></a> in
        a catastrophe.</p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Network security issues include protecting data from unauthorized access, protecting
        data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for
        recovery from breaches and data losses</p>
      <a name="Structure">
        <h2>Physical Structure</h2>
      </a>
      <p>Before discussing networks, we need to define some network attributes.</p>
      <h3>Type of Connection</h3>
      <p>A network is two or more devices connected through links. A link is a communications
        pathway that transfers data from one device to another. For visualization purposes, it is
        simplest to imagine any link as a line drawn between two points. For communication to
        occur, two devices must be connected in some way to the same link at the same time.
        There are two possible types of connections: point-to-point and multipoint.</p>
      <h3>Point-to-Point</h3>
      <p>A point-to-point connection provides a dedicated link between two
        devices. The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission between those two
        devices. Most point-to-point connections use an actual length of wire or cable to connect the two ends, but
        other options, such as microwave or satellite links, are also possible (see Figure 1.3a). When you change
        television channels by infrared remote control,
        you are establishing a point-to-point connection between the remote control and the
        television's control system.</p>
      <h3>Multipoint</h3>
      <p>A multipoint (also called multidrop) connection is one in which more
        than two specific devices share a single link (see Figure 1.3b).
        In a multipoint environment, the capacity of the channel is shared, either spatially
        or temporally. Ifseveral devices can use the link simultaneously, it is a spatially shared
        connection. If users must take turns, it is a timeshared connection</p>
      <img src="./img/Connections1,3.jpeg" alt="">
      <h3>Physical Topology</h3>
      <p>The term physical topology refers to the way in which a network is laid out physically.:
        two or more devices connect to a link; two or more links form a topology. The topology of a network is the
        geometric representation of the relationship of all the links and
        linking devices (usually called nodes) to one another. There are four basic topologies
        possible: mesh, star, bus, and ring (see Figure 1.4)</p>
      <img src="./img/1.4conections.jpeg" alt="">
      <h4>Mesh Topology</h4>
      <p>Mesh In a mesh topology, every device has a dedicated point-to-point link to every
        other device. The term dedicated means that the link carries traffic only between the
        two devices it connects. To find the number of physical links in a fully connected mesh
        network with n nodes, we first consider that each node must be connected to every
        other node. Node 1 must be connected to n - I nodes, node 2 must be connected to n - 1
        nodes, and finally node n must be connected to n - 1 nodes. We need n(n - 1) physical
        links. However, if each physical link allows communication in both directions (duplex
        mode), we can divide the number of links by 2. In other words, we can say that in a
        mesh topology, we need</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n(n -1) /2 </p>
      <p>duplex-mode links.
        To accommodate that many links, every device on the network must have n - 1
        input/output (VO) ports (see Figure 1.5) to be connected to the other n - 1 stations</p>
      <img src="./img/mEsh.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>A mesh offers several advantages over other network topologies. First, the use of
        dedicated links guarantees that each connection can carry its own data load, thus eliminating the traffic
        problems that can occur when links must be shared by multiple devices.
        Second, a mesh topology is robust. If one link becomes unusable, it does not incapacitate the entire system.
        Third, there is the advantage of privacy or security. When every
        message travels along a dedicated line, only the intended recipient sees it. Physical
        boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages. Finally, point-to-point
        links make fault identification and fault isolation easy. Traffic can be routed to avoid
        links with suspected problems. This facility enables the network manager to discover the
        precise location of the fault and aids in finding its cause and solution. </p>
      <p>The main disadvantages of a mesh are related to the amount of cabling and the
        number of I/O ports required. First, because every device must be connected to every
        other device, installation and reconnection are difficult. Second, the sheer bulk of the
        wiring can be greater than the available space (in walls, ceilings, or floors) can accommodate. Finally, the
        hardware required to connect each link (I/O ports and cable) can be
        prohibitively expensive. For these reasons a mesh topology is usually implemented in a
        limited fashion, for example, as a backbone connecting the main computers of a hybrid
        network that can include several other topologies.</p>
      <p>One practical example of a mesh topology is the connection of telephone regional
        offices in which each regional office needs to be connected to every other regional office</p>
      <h4>Star Topology</h4>
      <p>In a star topology, each device has a dedicated point-to-point link
        only to a central controller, usually called a hub. The devices are not directly linked to
        one another. Unlike a mesh topology, a star topology does not allow direct traffic
        between devices. The controller acts as an exchange: If one device wants to send data to
        another, it sends the data to the controller, which then relays the data to the other connected device (see
        Figure 1.6) .</p>
      <img src="./img/star.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>A star topology is less expensive than a mesh topology. In a star, each device needs
        only one link and one I/O port to connect it to any number of others. This factor also
        makes it easy to install and reconfigure. Far less cabling needs to be housed, and additions, moves, and
        deletions involve only one connection: between that device and the hub.</p>
      <p>Other advantages include robustness. If one link fails, only that link is affected. All
        other links remain active. This factor also lends itself to easy fault identification and fault isolation. As
        long as the hub is working, it can be used to monitor link problems
        and bypass defective links.
      <p>One big disadvantage of a star topology is the dependency of the whole topology
        on one single point, the hub. If the hub goes down, the whole system is dead.</p>
      <p>Although a star requires far less cable than a mesh, each node must be linked to a
        central hub. For this reason, often more cabling is required in a star than in some other
        topologies (such as ring or bus).</p>
      <p>The star topology is used in local-area networks (LANs),
        High-speed LANs often use a star topology with a central hub
      </p>
      <h4>Bus Topology</h4>
      <p>The preceding examples all describe point-to-point connections. A bus
        topology, on the other hand, is multipoint. One long cable acts as a backbone to link all
        the devices in a network (see Figure 1.7)</p>
      <img src="./img/bus.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>Nodes are connected to the bus cable by drop lines and taps. A drop line is a connection running between the
        device and the main cable. A tap is a connector that either
        splices into the main cable or punctures the sheathing of a cable to create a contact with
        the metallic core. As a signal travels along the backbone, some ofits energy is transformed
        into heat. Therefore, it becomes weaker and weaker as it travels farther and farther. For
        this reason there is a limit on the number of taps a bus can support and on the distance
        between those taps. </p>
      <p>Advantages of a bus topology include ease of installation. Backbone cable can be
        laid along the most efficient path, then connected to the nodes by drop lines of various
        lengths. In this way, a bus uses less cabling than mesh or star topologies. In a star, for
        example, four network devices in the same room require four lengths of cable reaching
        all the way to the hub. In a bus, this redundancy is eliminated. Only the backbone cable
        stretches through the entire facility. Each drop line has to reach only as far as the nearest point on the
        backbone.</p>
      <p>Disadvantages include difficult reconnection and fault isolation. A bus is usually
        designed to be optimally efficient at installation. It can therefore be difficult to add new
        devices. Signal reflection at the taps can cause degradation in quality. This degradation
        can be controlled by limiting the number and spacing of devices connected to a given
        length of cable. Adding new devices may therefore require modification or replacement
        of the backbone.</p>
      <p>In addition, a fault or break in the bus cable stops all transmission, even between
        devices on the same side of the problem. The damaged area reflects signals back in the
        direction of origin, creating noise in both directions.
        Bus topology was the one of the first topologies used in the design of early localarea networks. Ethernet LANs
        can use a bus topology</p>
      <h4>Ring Topology</h4>
      <p>In a ring topology, each device has a dedicated point-to-point connection with only the two devices on either
        side of it. A signal is passed along the ring
        in one direction, from device to device, until it reaches its destination. Each device in
        the ring incorporates a repeater. When a device receives a signal intended for another
        device, its repeater regenerates the bits and passes them along (see Figure 1.8)</p>
      <img src="./img/RIng.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>A ring is relatively easy to install and reconfigure. Each device is linked to only its
        immediate neighbors (either physically or logically). To add or delete a device requires
        changing only two connections. The only constraints are media and traffic considerations (maximum ring length
        and number of devices). In addition, fault isolation is simplified. Generally in a ring, a signal is circulating
        at all times. If one device does not
        receive a signal within a specified period, it can issue an alarm. The alarm alerts the
        network operator to the problem and its location. </p>
      <p>However, unidirectional traffic can be a disadvantage. In a simple ring, a break in
        the ring (such as a disabled station) can disable the entire network. This weakness can
        be solved by using a dual ring or a switch capable of closing off the break.
        Ring topology was prevalent when <a class="glossary_anchors" href="./Glossary.html#Gibm" id="ibm"><b>IBM</b></a> introduced its local-area network Token
        Ring. Today, the need for higher-speed LANs has made this topology less popular.</p>
      <h4>Hybrid Topology</h4>
      <p>A network can be hybrid. For example, we can have a main star topology with each branch connecting several
        stations in a bus topology as shown in Figure 1.9</p>
      <img src="./img/hybrid.jpeg" alt="">
      <a name="Models">
        <h2>Network Models</h2>
      </a>
      <p>Computer networks are created by different entities. Standards are needed so that these
        heterogeneous networks can communicate with one another. The two best-known standards are the OSI model and the Internet model. In Chapter 2 we discuss these two
        models. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model defines a seven-layer network; the Internet model defines a five-layer network. This book is based on the Internet
        model with occasional references to the OSI model.</p>
        <h3><b><i>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Data Model:</i></b></h3>

                process, each layer (from top to bottom) will add a specific header to the raw data. <br>-At the
                reception, headers are eliminated conversely until the data arrived to the receiving

        <a name="Categories">
        <h2>Categories of Network</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Today when we speak of networks, we are generally referring to two primary categories: local-area networks and wide-area networks. The category into which a network
          falls is determined by its size. A LAN normally covers an area less than 2 mi; a WAN can
          be worldwide. Networks of a size in between are normally referred to as metropolitanarea networks and span tens of miles. </p>
          <h3>Local Area Network</h3>
          <p>A local area network (LAN) is usually privately owned and links the devices in a single
          office, building, or campus (see Figure 1.10). Depending on the needs of an organization
          and the type of technology used, a LAN can be as simple as two PCs and a printer in
          someone's home office; or it can extend throughout a company and include audio and
          video peripherals. Currently, LAN size is limited to a few kilometers</p>
          <img src="./img/LAN.jpeg" alt="">
          <p>LANs are designed to allow resources to be shared between personal computers or
            workstations. The resources to be shared can include hardware (e.g., a printer), software
            (e.g., an application program), or data. A common example of a LAN, found in many
            business environments, links a workgroup of task-related computers, for example, engineering workstations or accounting PCs. One of the computers may be given a largecapacity disk drive and may become a server to clients. Software can be stored on this
            central server and used as needed by the whole group. In this example, the size of the
            LAN may be determined by licensing restrictions on the number of users per copy of software, or by restrictions on the number of users licensed to access the operating system.
            In addition to size, LANs are distinguished from other types of networks by their
            transmission media and topology. In general, a given LAN will use only one type of
            transmission medium. The most common LAN topologies are bus, ring, and star.
            Early LANs had data rates in the 4 to 16 megabits per second (Mbps) range. Today,
            however, speeds are normally 100 or 1000 Mbps.
            Wireless LANs are the newest evolution in LAN technology.</p>
            <h3>Wide Area Network</h3>
            <p>A wide area network (WAN) provides long-distance transmission of data, image, audio,
            and video information over large geographic areas that may comprise a country, a continent, or even the whole world. A WAN can be as complex as the backbones that connect the Internet or as
            simple as a dial-up line that connects a home computer to the Internet. We normally refer
            to the first as a switched WAN and to the second as a point-to-point WAN (Figure 1.11).
            The switched WAN connects the end systems, which usually comprise a router (internetworking connecting device) that connects to another LAN or WAN. The point-to-point
            WAN is normally a line leased from a telephone or cable TV provider that connects a
            home computer or a small LAN to an Internet service provider (ISP). This type of WAN
            is often used to provide Internet access</p>
            <img src="./img/WAN.jpeg" alt="">
          <p>An early example of a switched WAN is X.25, a network designed to provide connectivity between end users. As we will see in Chapter 18, X.25 is being gradually
            replaced by a high-speed, more efficient network called Frame Relay. A good example
            of a switched WAN is the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, which is a network with fixed-size data unit packets called cells. We will discuss ATM in Chapter 18.
            Another example ofWANs is the wireless WAN that is becoming more and more popular. </p>
            <h4>Metropolitan Area Networks</h4>
            <p>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network with a size between a LAN and a
            WAN. It normally covers the area inside a town or a city. It is designed for customers
            who need a high-speed connectivity, normally to the Internet, and have endpoints
            spread over a city or part of city. A good example of a MAN is the part of the telephone
            company network that can provide a high-speed DSL line to the customer. Another
            example is the cable TV network that originally was designed for cable TV, but today
            can also be used for high-speed data connection to the Internet.</p>
        <a name="Interconection">
          <h2>Interconnection of Network</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Today, it is very rare to see a LAN, a MAN, or a LAN in isolation; they are connected to one another. When two or more networks are connected, they become an
          internetwork, or internet.
          As an example, assume that an organization has two offices, one on the east coast
          and the other on the west coast. The established office on the west coast has a bus topology
          LAN; the newly opened office on the east coast has a star topology LAN. The president of
          the company lives somewhere in the middle and needs to have control over the company
          from her horne. To create a backbone WAN for connecting these three entities (two
          LANs and the president's computer), a switched WAN (operated by a service provider
          such as a telecom company) has been leased. To connect the LANs to this switched
          WAN, however, three point-to-point WANs are required. These point-to-point WANs
          can be a high-speed DSL line offered by a telephone company or a cable modern line
          offered by a cable TV provider as shown in Figure 1.12.</p>
