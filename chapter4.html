    <a name="Protocols"><h1><u><b>Protocols and Standard</b></u></h1></a>
    <big>
      <p>In this section, we define two widely used terms: protocols and standards. First, we
        define protocol, which is synonymous with rule. Then we discuss standards, which are
        agreed-upon rules.</p>
    </big>
    <a name="Protocol1">
      <h2><u>Protocols</u></h2>
    </a>
    <big>
      <p>In computer networks, communication occurs between entities in different systems. An
        entity is anything capable of sending or receiving information. However, two entities cannot simply send bit
        streams to each other and expect to be understood. For communication
        to occur, the entities must agree on a protocol. A protocol is a set of rules that govern data
        communications. A protocol defines what is communicated, how it is communicated, and
        when it is communicated. The key elements of a protocol are syntax, semantics, and timing.</p>
    </big>
    <ul>
      <big>
        <li><b>Syntax:-</b>
          <p>The term syntax refers to the structure or format of the data, meaning the
            order in which they are presented. For example, a simple protocol might expect the
            first 8 bits of data to be the address of the sender, the second 8 bits to be the address
            of the receiver, and the rest of the stream to be the message itself</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Semantic:-</b>
          <p>The word semantics refers to the meaning of each section of bits.
            How is a particular pattern to be interpreted, and what action is to be taken based
            on that interpretation? For example, does an address identify the route to be taken
            or the final destination of the message?</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Timing:-</b>
          <p>The word semantics refers to the meaning of each section of bits.
            How is a particular pattern to be interpreted, and what action is to be taken based
            on that interpretation? For example, does an address identify the route to be taken
            or the final destination of the message?</p>
        </li>
      </big>
    </ul>
    <a name="Standard">
      <h2><u>Standard</u></h2>
    </a>
    <big>
      <p>Standards are essential in creating and maintaining an open and competitive market for
        equipment manufacturers and in guaranteeing national and international interoperability
        of data and telecommunications technology and processes. Standards provide guidelines
        to manufacturers, vendors, government agencies, and other service providers to ensure
        the kind of interconnectivity necessary in today's marketplace and in international communications. Data
        communication standards fall into two categories: de facto (meaning
        "by fact" or "by convention") and de jure (meaning "by law" or "by regulation")</p>
    </big>
    <ul>
      <big>
        <li>Standards that have not been approved by an organized body but have
          been adopted as standards through widespread use are de facto standards. De facto
          standards are often established originally by manufacturers who seek to define the
          functionality of a new product or technology</li><br>
        <li>Those standards that have been legislated by an officially recognized body
          are de jure standards</li>
      </big>
    </ul>
    <a name="Organization">
      <h2><u>Standard Organization</u></h2>
    </a>
    <big>
      <p>Standards are developed through the cooperation of standards creation committees,
        forums, and government regulatory agencies.
        Standards Creation Committees
        While many organizations are dedicated to the establishment of standards, data telecommunications in North
        America rely primarily on those published by the following</p>
    </big>
    <ul>
      <big>
        <li>International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO is a multinational
          body whose membership is drawn mainly from the standards creation committees
          of various governments throughout the world. The ISO is active in developing
          cooperation in the realms of scientific, technological, and economic activity</li><br>
        <li>International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standards
          Sector (ITU-T). By the early 1970s, a number of countries were defining national
          standards for telecommunications, but there was still little international compatibility. The United Nations
          responded by forming, as part of its International
          Telecommunication Union (ITU), a committee, the Consultative Committee
          for International Telegraphy and Telephony (CCITT). This committee was
          devoted to the research and establishment of standards for telecommunications in
          general and for phone and data systems in particular. On March 1, 1993, the name
          of this committee was changed to the International Telecommunication UnionTelecommunication Standards Sector
          (ITU-T).</li><br>
        <li>American National Standards Institute (<a class="glossary_anchors" href="./Glossary.html#Gansi" id="Ansi"><b>ANSI</b></a>). Despite its name, the American
          National Standards Institute is a completely private, nonprofit corporation not affiliated with the U.S.
          federal government. However, all ANSI activities are undertaken
          with the welfare of the United States and its citizens occupying primary importance.</li> <br>
        <li>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The Institute of
          Electrical and Electronics Engineers is the largest professional engineering society in
          the world. International in scope, it aims to advance theory, creativity, and product
          quality in the fields of electrical engineering, electronics, and radio as well as in all
          related branches of engineering. As one of its goals, the IEEE oversees the development and adoption of
          international standards for</li><br>
        <li>Electronic Industries Association (EIA). Aligned with ANSI, the Electronic
          Industries Association is a nonprofit organization devoted to the promotion of
          electronics manufacturing concerns. Its activities include public awareness education
          and lobbying efforts in addition to standards development. In the field of information
          technology, the EIA has made significant contributions by defining physical connection interfaces and
          electronic signaling specifications for data comm</li>

    </ul>
    <big><ul><li><h3>Forums:-</h3>
    <p>Telecommunications technology development is moving faster than the ability of standards committees to ratify standards. Standards committees are procedural bodies and
      by nature slow-moving. To accommodate the need for working models and agreements
      and to facilitate the standardization process, many special-interest groups have developed forums made up of representatives from interested corporations. The forums
      work with universities and users to test, evaluate, and standardize new technologies. By
      concentrating their efforts on a particular technology, the forums are able to speed
      acceptance and use of those technologies in the telecommunications community. The
      forums present their conclusions to the standards bodies.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Regulatory Agencies:-</h3>
    <p>All communications technology is subject to regulation by government agencies such
      as the Federal Communications Commission (<a class="glossary_anchors" href="./Glossary.html#Gfcc" id="Fcc"><b>FCC</b></a>) in the United States. The purpose of these agencies is to protect the public interest by regulating radio, television,
      and wire/cable communications. The FCC has authority over interstate and international commerce as it relates to commun</p></li>
    </ul></big>
  <a name="Internet"><h2><u>Internet Standard</u></h2></a>
  <big>
    <p>An Internet standard is a thoroughly tested specification that is useful to and adhered
      to by those who work with the Internet. It is a formalized regulation that must be followed. There is a strict procedure by which a specification attains Internet standard
      status. A specification begins as an Internet draft. An Internet draft is a working document (a work in progress) with no official status and a 6-month lifetime. Upon recommendation from the Internet authorities, a draft may be published as a Request for
      Comment (<a class="glossary_anchors" href="./Glossary.html#Grfc" id="Rfc"><b>RFC</b></a>). Each RFC is edited, assigned a number, and made available to all
      interested parties. RFCs go through maturity levels and are categorized according to
      their requirement level</p>
